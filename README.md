## Project Roadmap

### Phase 1: Initial Setup (Completed)

*   ✅ Set up Vue.js project with Vuetify and Vuex/Pinia.
*   ✅ Integrate Monaco Editor using `monaco-vue`.
*   ✅ Implement basic routing (login, IDE workspace).

### Phase 2: Authentication with OAuth 2.0 (In Progress)

*   Deciding Between:
    *   A - Implement OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant flow.
    *   B - Use Google (Firebase) as the identity provider.
*   Create a backend server (Express.js) to handle token exchange and refresh.
*   ✅ Securely store the Client Secret on the backend.
*   Store access tokens and refresh tokens (if applicable) in the frontend (Vuex/Pinia and localStorage).
*   ✅ Implement token refresh logic.

### Phase 3: Basic ML Autocompletion (In Progress)

*   ✅ Select a suitable pre-trained open-source model (**CodeBERT**).
*   Create a backend API endpoint (`/api/autocomplete`) to handle autocompletion requests.

## Architecture

### Frontend Components

*   **`FileExplorer.vue`:** Manages the file tree, allowing users to create, open, rename, and delete files.
*   **`CodeEditor.vue`:** The core Monaco Editor component for real-time collaborative coding, now with ML-powered autocompletion using CodeBERT.
*   **`OutputWindow.vue`:** Displays the output of code executed via Judge0.
*   **`CollaborationPanel.vue`:** Shows a list of online collaborators and their cursor positions.
*   **`Navbar.vue`:** Provides navigation, theme switching, and other global actions.
*   **`OAuth2Callback.vue`:** Handles the redirect from Google after authorization, exchanges the code for tokens, and stores them.
*   **`services/oauth2.js`:** Manages the OAuth 2.0 flow, including generating the authorization URL, exchanging the code for tokens, and refreshing tokens (by interacting with the backend).
*   **`store/modules/oauth2.js` (Vuex):**  Manages the OAuth 2.0 state (access token, refresh token, expiration) in the Vuex store.

### Backend Architecture

*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   `POST /api/token`: Handles the exchange of the authorization code for an access token and refresh token (securely using the Client Secret).
    *   `POST /api/refresh`: Refreshes the access token using the refresh token.
    *   `GET /api/config` (Optional): Provides public configuration information to the frontend (e.g., Google Client ID).
    *   `POST /api/autocomplete`: Handles autocompletion requests, loads the CodeBERT model, performs inference, and returns suggestions.
    *   `POST /files/content`: Saves file content to the server (currently stored as text blobs in PostgreSQL for the demo). - *Planned*
    *   `POST /execute`: Sends code to Judge0 for execution and returns the results. - *Planned*
*   **WebSocket Events (Planned):**
    *   `cursor-update`: Broadcasts real-time cursor position changes to all collaborators in the same session.
    *   `file-update`: Synchronizes file content changes across all clients.
    *   `output-update`: Shares the output of code execution with all collaborators.
