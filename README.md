## Overview

AggieCode is a web-based, real-time collaborative Integrated Development Environment (IDE) specifically designed to enhance the learning experience for first-year engineering students engaged in team-based lab environments. It empowers students to collaboratively write, execute, and debug Python and C++ code while sharing outputs in real-time. AggieCode's intuitive interface, inspired by Visual Studio Code and powered by the Monaco Editor.

## Project Roadmap

### Phase 1: Initial Setup (Completed)

*   ✅ Set up Vue.js project with Vuetify and Pinia.
*   ✅ Integrate Monaco Editor using `monaco-vue`.
*   ✅ Implement basic routing (login, IDE workspace).

### Phase 2: Collaboration (In Progress)

*   ✅ Integrate Y.js and `y-websocket` for real-time document synchronization.
*   ✅ Implement Socket.IO for real-time event broadcasting.
*   ✅ Develop collaborative editing features:
    *   ✅ Cursor highlighting.
    *   ✅ File sharing.

### Phase 3: Code Execution

*   Integrate Judge0 API for server-side code execution.
*   Design a shared output window.
*   (Pending) Explore Py2Wasm for client-side Python execution.

### Phase 4: Authentication & Session Management

*   Integrate Firebase Auth.
*   Implement session-based authentication and role management.
*   Enable joining specific lab sessions via session codes.

### Phase 5: Finalize UI & Testing

*   Refine UI using Vuetify.
*   Conduct comprehensive testing (real-time collaboration, edge cases).
*   Integrate Sentry for error tracking.

### Phase 6: Demo Preparation

*   Deploy the project (locally or cloud).
*   Prepare sample lab exercises.
*   Document demo flow and expected outcomes.

## Architecture

### Frontend Components

*   **`FileExplorer.vue`:** Manages the file tree, allowing users to create, open, rename, and delete files.
*   **`CodeEditor.vue`:** The core Monaco Editor component for real-time collaborative coding.
*   **`OutputWindow.vue`:** Displays the output of code executed via Judge0.
*   **`CollaborationPanel.vue`:** Shows a list of online collaborators and their cursor positions.
*   **`Navbar.vue`:** Provides navigation, theme switching, and other global actions.

### Backend Architecture

*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   `POST /auth/login`: Handles user authentication via Firebase Auth.
    *   `GET /files/tree`: Retrieves the file structure for the current project.
    *   `POST /files/content`: Saves file content to the server (currently stored as text blobs in PostgreSQL for the demo).
    *   `POST /execute`: Sends code to Judge0 for execution and returns the results.
*   **WebSocket Events:**
    *   `cursor-update`: Broadcasts real-time cursor position changes to all collaborators in the same session.
    *   `file-update`: Synchronizes file content changes across all clients.
    *   `output-update`: Shares the output of code execution with all collaborators.
