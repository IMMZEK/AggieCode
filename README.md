## Development

### Bazel Setup

AggieCode uses Bazel as its build system for consistent and reproducible builds across all environments. The current Bazel setup includes:

- Root-level BUILD.bazel file for project-wide targets
- Module-specific BUILD.bazel files in respective directories
- Centralized dependency management

#### Key Bazel Commands

- Build and test all targets:
  ```
  bazel build //:all
  ```

- Run frontend development server:
  ```
  bazel run //frontend:dev
  ```

## Architecture

### Frontend Components

*   **FileExplorer.vue:** Manages the file tree, allowing users to create, open, rename, and delete files.
*   **CodeEditor.vue:** The core Monaco Editor component for real-time collaborative coding, now with ML-powered autocompletion using CodeBERT.
*   **OutputWindow.vue:** Displays the output of code executed via Judge0.
*   **CollaborationPanel.vue:** Shows a list of online collaborators and their cursor positions.
*   **Navbar.vue:** Provides navigation, theme switching, and other global actions.
*   **OAuth2Callback.vue:** Replaced with Firebase for Authentification.
*   **services/auth.js:** Manages Firebase authentication related logic such as token refresh and generating authorization URL.
*   **store/modules/auth.js (Vuex):** Manages the Firebase authentication state.

### Backend Architecture

*   **Main Backend (Node.js):**
    *   Handles general API requests, user sessions (with Firebase), and potentially serves as a proxy to other services.
    *   API Endpoints:
        *   POST /api/token:  (Removed since we are using Firebase)
        *   POST /api/refresh: (Removed since we are using Firebase)
        *   GET /api/config (Optional): Provides public configuration information to the frontend (e.g., Google Client ID).
        *   POST /files/content: Saves file content to the server (currently stored as text blobs in PostgreSQL for the demo). - *Planned*
*   **Code Execution Service (Go):**
    *   Provides secure code execution in a sandboxed environment.
    *   API Endpoint:
        *   POST /api/execute: Accepts code, language, and optional input, executes the code, and returns the output.
*   **ML Autocompletion Service (Go) - *Planned*:**
    *   Provides intelligent code suggestions using a pre-trained CodeBERT model.
    *   API Endpoint:
        *   POST /api/autocomplete: Accepts code, cursor position, and language, and returns a list of autocompletion suggestions.
*   **Real-Time Collaboration Server (Go or Node.js) - *Partially Implemented*:**
    *   Handles real-time document synchronization using Y.js and potentially other real-time events using Socket.IO.
    *   May be implemented in Node.js (using y-websocket) or in Go (using go-yjs or an alternative technology if go-yjs is not viable).
*   **WebSocket Events (Planned):**
    *   cursor-update: Broadcasts real-time cursor position changes to all collaborators in the same session.
    *   file-update: Synchronizes file content changes across all clients.
    *   output-update: Shares the output of code execution with all collaborators.
